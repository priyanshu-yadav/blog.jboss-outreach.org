so I visited coding blocks in Noida and there I sat in a classroom with my brother and after some time our teacher came in, so he start teaching in a polite way by asking name and telling about coding and google Code-In that it is easy to learn and making our account in gitter. He also tell us about task to do and awards that we will get.In the break time we went outside and bought chips and cold - drink to eat . Jboss has helped me in learning coding and to know that google is not only a search ingin it more than that.
